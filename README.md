üìä Project: AdventureWorks Sales Analytics Dashboard
Description & Purpose:
This project features an end-to-end business intelligence dashboard built using Power BI Desktop and the AdventureWorks dataset. The goal of the project was to transform raw sales and customer data into an insightful, interactive dashboard that allows business users to monitor key performance indicators and make data-driven decisions.

The dashboard provides comprehensive analysis across sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and regional profitability. It includes dynamic KPI cards, trend analysis, and comparative metrics (such as Year-over-Year growth and Year-to-Date sales) to highlight performance over time. Slicers and filters for date, region, and product category allow users to customize the insights according to their needs.

The dashboard was designed with clean visual aesthetics and a user-friendly layout to mimic a real-world business reporting scenario.
